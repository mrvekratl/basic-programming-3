# Basic C# Programming Exercises

This repository contains solutions to various basic programming exercises implemented in C#. These exercises focus on fundamental programming concepts, including conditional statements, loops, methods, and array manipulations.

## Exercises

1. **Determine Day of the Week**  
   - Prompts the user to input a number between 1 and 7.  
   - Displays the corresponding day of the week using a `switch-case` structure.  
   - Example:  
     Input: `3`  
     Output: `HaftanÄ±n 3. gÃ¼nÃ¼: Ã‡arÅŸamba`

2. **Basic Arithmetic Operations with Retry**  
   - Allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).  
   - Operations are implemented as separate methods.  
   - The program loops back for another calculation if the user inputs `0` and exits when `5` is entered.  

3. **Multiples of 7 in an Array**  
   - Creates an array of 20 elements, filling it with multiples of 7.  
   - Displays the contents of the array side by side.

4. **Fill Array with Prime Numbers**  
   - Initializes a 15-element array with consecutive prime numbers, starting from the smallest prime (2).  
   - Includes a helper method to check if a number is prime.  

5. **Separate Even and Odd Numbers**  
   - Generates an array of 10 random integers between 1 and 100.  
   - Separates even and odd numbers into two separate arrays.  
   - Prints all arrays (original, even, and odd) side by side using a custom display method.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred C# IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Run the solution file or execute the `Main` function to test individual exercises.
4. Follow on-screen prompts to interact with each program.

## Highlights

- **Switch-Case Statements**: Used to simplify conditional logic.
- **Modular Code**: Each exercise is structured with reusable methods to enhance readability and maintainability.
- **Array Manipulations**: Demonstrates filling arrays, iterating through elements, and separating values based on conditions.
- **Randomization**: Generates dynamic arrays for realistic testing.
